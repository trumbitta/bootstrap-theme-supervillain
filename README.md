# Supervillain Theme for Bootstrap 3

Supervillain is a theme for Bootstrap 3 built with [Themestrap](https://github.com/divshot/themestrap)
.
It's based on Thomas Park's Superhero from Bootswatch version 2.

Currently a work in progress.  
I will update the version number to 1.0.0 when I'm fine with the theme and I'll have fixed any TODO currently known to me.

## Quick install

    bower install bootstrap-theme-supervillain
